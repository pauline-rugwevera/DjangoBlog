# Web development-the blog
# Introduction
Web development is my 4th project I did with Code Institute. The requiremenrs for this project was to build a Full Stack site that required me to set up an authentication system that provide a role-based access to the site's data. Web development-the blog is a public community blog platform where users can interact with other users' posts. Authenticated users have more advantages as they can create and share their web development posts with other users.
